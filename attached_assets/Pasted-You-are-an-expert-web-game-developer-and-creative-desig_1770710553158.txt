You are an expert web game developer and creative designer.

Build a browser-based endless runner game inspired by Subway Surfers.

GAME OVERVIEW:
The game features two human characters:
- Character A (Player) – runs forward, controlled by the user
- Character B (Loved One) – runs ahead, slightly faster, always visible

The goal is NOT to catch, but to keep running and progressing emotionally.

CHARACTER SYSTEM:
- Both characters use customizable PNG image placeholders.
- The user can upload and replace character PNGs at any time.
- Characters are rendered in a semi-3D or 2.5D endless runner style.

GAME MECHANICS:
- Auto-forward running.
- Player can swipe / arrow keys to:
  - Move left/right
  - Jump
  - Slide
- Obstacles similar to Subway Surfers:
  - Trains
  - Barriers
  - Gaps
- No coins; progression is time and distance-based.

LEVEL & MOOD PROGRESSION:
The game has emotional phases instead of traditional levels.

Phase 1 – Longing 💔
- Slow pace
- Dark, muted environment
- Soft rain or night city visuals
- Messages appear:
  "I miss you every second"
  "Some distances are felt, not seen"

Phase 2 – Hope 🌅
- Speed slightly increases
- Warmer lighting
- Sunrise sky
- Messages appear:
  "Love finds its way"
  "Every step brings me closer"

Phase 3 – Gratitude 💌
- Bright Valentine-themed visuals
- Hearts, soft particles, rose petals
- Messages appear:
  "Thank you for choosing me"
  "You are my forever"

Phase 4 – Joy ❤️‍🔥
- Fast pace
- Vibrant colors
- Celebration effects
- Messages appear:
  "This run is our story"
  "I’d run a thousand lives for you"

MOOD SWING SYSTEM:
- Each phase triggers:
  - Background color changes
  - Music changes
  - Running speed adjustments
- Messages fade in smoothly at key moments.
- Messages appear above the runner or floating in the environment.

VALENTINE MESSAGE SYSTEM:
- Messages are stored in an array.
- Messages rotate randomly per phase.
- Messages animate in with soft fade and glow effects.
- Support custom message input by the user.

UI & UX:
- Minimal HUD
- Progress bar labeled "Distance of Love"
- Heart icon instead of score
- Restart screen shows:
  "Love never ends, try again ❤️"

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Runs fully in the browser
- Mobile and desktop responsive
- Smooth 60 FPS animations
- No backend required for MVP
- Data stored locally (localStorage)

SUGGESTED TECH STACK:
- HTML5 Canvas or Three.js
- JavaScript or TypeScript
- GSAP for animations
- Howler.js for sound
- Vite or Next.js for build

OUTPUT:
Provide:
1. Game architecture
2. Scene flow
3. State management for mood phases
4. Character placeholder logic
5. Message rendering logic
6. Sample code structure
